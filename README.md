# 🌹 Joint Rose Diagram Plot (Python + Matplotlib)

This script creates a **rose diagram** showing:
- Joint set orientations (dip directions field measured)
- Their relative frequencies (frequency of number of major and minor joint sets)
- Bisecting and perpendicular lines between joint sets (Gives the orientation of possible tunnel alignment)

It’s a quick tool for **structural geology** and **rock mechanics** analysis.
